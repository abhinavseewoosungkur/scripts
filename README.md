scripts
=======

A collection of scripts for the Asus wl500g series of routers including the Asus RT-Nx series.


The scripts
-----------
The scripts in this repo help to auto configure or auto install certain features. For example, 
the oleg-entware.sh prepares an Oleg firmware to auto mount a USB drive and to also start and stop service scripts.

Firmware compatibility list
---------------------------
Oleg - https://code.google.com/p/wl500g/

Warning
-------
A router may not be able to download a script directly from github because of HTTPS, as the implementation of wget
does not support it.
